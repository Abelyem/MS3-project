# Book Den - Data Centric Milestone Project

Book Den is a website which alows users to search and access books' description, name of author, and image. To this, there will be 
an additional link added to allow the user to read snippets/excerpt of the book from google http://books.google.co.uk/ / http://books.google.com/.

The site will also allow registered users to review any books they've read, which other (both registered and non-registered) users will have access
to, giving them an insight into what others have thought of the same books / books they may not have yet read / books they were considering purchasing. 

Each review added by registered accounts will include the features of updating, editing, and deleting their inital entry.



## UX

As an avid book reader, I want a place where I can search for new books.
As an avid book reader, I want to leave reviews, and access reviews others have left to make informed decisions on books I've not yet read 
or books I would have otherwise not considered reading.
